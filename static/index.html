    <h1>Good form bad form</h1>
    <p>There are two forms below. Each one would make a POST request to an endpoint at the server.
        The good form would receive a redirect (HTTP 303) as a response, while the bad form would receive
        a "created" response (HTTP 201). One concern we have when POSTing through forms is we want
        to stop the user from accidentally POSTing the form twice, which can happen when the user messes
        around with the backward/forward or refresh buttons in their browser.</p>
    <section id="forms-container">
        <form method="POST" action="/good-form">
            <h2>Good form</h2>
            <input name="form-input" type="text" />
            <button type="submit">Send</button>
        </form>
        <form method="POST" action="/bad-form">
            <h2>Bad form</h2>
            <input name="form-input" type="text" />
            <button type="submit">Send</button>
        </form>
    </section>
    <p>The good form is "good" because it prevents this from happening &mdash; the "after submit" state of the web site is effectively
        removed from the browser's history stack. With the bad form however, the "after submit" state is pushed
        on to the browser's history stack, which means when the user reaches the "after submit" page,
        clicking the browser refresh would cause another POST to occur. This is when the browser might try to stop the user
        by giving them the "Confirm Form Resubmission" popup. Clicking backwards then forwards again
        might also cause another POST to occur (or maybe the browser might automatically prevent this). Check the server logs to see this.</p>
    <p>Where'd I hear about this? In this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/1083471">SO answer</a>. This answer also mentions
        that we'd usually go for the HTTP 303 approach only for web page POSTs, not API POSTs. For APIs, HTTP 201.
        Another concern is we might want the user to receive some king of message to make it clear to the user that
        the submit was successful. We could encode this within a query string, but this isn't very secure. Might have
        to figure out another way here.</p>
    <p>HTTP 303s are meant to indicate to the client that the redirected resource represents the final
        state after the POST has occurred (<a href="https://httpstatuses.com/303">source</a>).</p>
